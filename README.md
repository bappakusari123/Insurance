**Project Overview: Insurance Portfolio & Claims Intelligence**
This Power BI project provides a 360-degree analysis of insurance portfolio health, focusing on underwriting profitability, claims frequency, and risk exposure. The dashboard transforms raw policy and claims transactional data into actionable insights, allowing stakeholders to identify high-risk segments, optimize premium pricing strategies, and monitor the Loss Ratio across custom timeframes.

****Business Questions Answered**
1. Portfolio & Risk Performance
•	Who are our most/least profitable segments? Identify the Top/Bottom 5 Policy Categories (e.g., Auto, Home, Life) by Total Premium, Claims Paid, and Net Profit.
•	What is our total volume? Tracking the Total Number of Active Policies and newly issued quotes.
2. Claims & Profitability Trends
•	How do loss trends vary over time? Visualizing Gross Written Premium (GWP) and Incurred Losses across daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual grains to spot seasonal risk patterns.
•	What is the "Revenue vs. Risk" relationship? A deep dive into the correlation between Premiums Collected and Claims Paid (The Loss Ratio).
3. Advanced Comparative Analytics
•	How does this quarter compare to last? A dynamic Period-over-Period (PoP) comparison for Premiums, Claims, and Loss Ratios based on two user-selected dates.
•	Are discounts impacting our margins? Analyzing the Average Discount/No-Claims Bonus (NCB) offered in each discount tier to see if price cuts correlate with higher claim frequency.
4. Geographic & Granular Drill-Downs
•	Where is our risk concentrated? Distribution of Premiums and Claims by City/Region to identify "catastrophe zones" or high-growth markets.
•	What is the story behind a specific policy? A comprehensive Policy Detail Matrix allowing users to filter by Policy ID, Customer, or Coverage Type to see specific details like Net Premium, Deductibles, and Claim Status.
